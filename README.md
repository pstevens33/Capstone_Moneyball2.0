If you’ve ever seen the movie, “Moneyball”, you hear the old school scouts constantly saying that they like a player because “he has a good face”. They believe that the construction of a prospect’s facial features can determine his projectability into the big leagues. This time-honored way of thinking was somewhat discredited by the use of sabermetrics in the analysis of players, a system coined “moneyball.”
I will to take a deeper look into the data behind the old scouts’ way of thinking and run a picture of every baseball player in history through a convolutional neural network in order to see if there really is a correlation between facial features and performance.
